1.	You work in a Zoo as the top computer developer. A new employee on their first day was told to count the giraffes and elephants. When entering the values into Zoo computer system they mixed up the count of the elephants with the giraffes. Write code to swap the values as to what they should be and save the Zoo . Use 2 variables and name them appropriately. Use cin, cout and 2 variables.
2.	Write a simple simulation of a computer that lies. When the user enters a number your code outputs “Even” if the number is odd and “Odd” when the number is even. 
3.	You are software developer for a well known online retailer. The “parcels picker system” picks the largest of 3 numbers (sizes of parcel) inputted into the computer console. Write code to find largest number among three numbers and output to the console the number so as the “fulfilment operator” can ship the correct parcel.
